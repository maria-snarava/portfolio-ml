# Machine Learning Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases projects demonstrating my skills and experience in various machine-learning techniques and applications.

## Project 1: [Dashboard for Sentimental analysis of Tweets about major NASDAQ-listed companies in 2019 year](https://github.com/maria-snarava/portfolio-ml/blob/main/Dashboard)

### Overview

This project uses a dataset [Tweets about the Top Companies from 2015 to 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/tweets-about-the-top-companies-from-2015-to-2020/data), featuring tweets related to major NASDAQ-listed companies, that was posted between 01-01-2019 and 31-12-2019. Sentiment analysis was performed using the NLTK library, along with a financial dictionary to better capture the nuances of financial terms. Engagement metrics were computed based on the number of likes, retweets, and comments each tweet received. You can find the preprocessing steps and code on the projectâ€™s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maria-snarava/portfolio-ml).

### Key Features
- Number of tweets by company plot (Histogram, pie chart, timeline)
- Engagement plot (Histogram, pie chart, timeline)
- Detailed analysis for selected company:
- Number of Tweets by Sentiment for selected company (Histogram, pie chart, timeline)
- Number of tweets about apple by sentiment vs stock price for selected company
- Word cloud by sentiment for selected company
- Random tweet about selected company by sentiment
- Top 5 Most Engaging Tweets About selected company by sentiment

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Streamlit
-  NLTK library

## [Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction With Logistic Regression](https://github.com/maria-snarava/portfolio-ml/blob/main/CustomerChurnPrediction.ipynb)

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to predict customer churn in an e-commerce company.

### Overview
Customer churn, or customer attrition, is critical for many businesses. This project uses logistic regression to predict which customers will likely churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing 
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of logistic regression using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation and interpretation

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set, providing a solid baseline for churn prediction.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Upcoming Projects
- Recommender System for online store using deep learning and content-based filtering
- Product classification by Image with Convolutional Neural Networks
