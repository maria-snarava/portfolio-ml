# Machine Learning Engineer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases projects demonstrating my skills and experience in various machine learning techniques and applications.

## [Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction With Logistic Regression](https://github.com/maria-snarava/portfolio-ml/blob/main/CustomerChurnPrediction.ipynb)

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to predict customer churn in an e-commerce company.

### Overview
Customer churn, or customer attrition, is critical for many businesses. This project uses logistic regression to predict which customers will likely churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing 
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of logistic regression using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation and interpretation

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set, providing a solid baseline for churn prediction.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Upcoming Projects
- Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis
- Time Series Forecasting for Stock Prices

## About Me
I am a Backend Developer with 6 years of expertise in e-commerce with Magento 2, using PHP, SQL, and JS. I participated in the creation and maintenance of some of the most popular Magento extensions, that are used on more than 40,000 stores worldwide.

My Computer Science degree from Belarusian State University provided me with a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software engineering principles. In addition, right now I am expanding my skill set into the field of Data Science. I am currently studying Machine Learning, with a focus on Advanced Algorithms, to use it in my work. This knowledge will allow me to integrate data science and machine learning with backend development to create smarter, more efficient applications.
